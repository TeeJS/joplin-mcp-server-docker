"""Link graph over Joplin notes.

Joplin's Data API can tell you what a note contains but not what points at it,
and its search is literal, so backlinks are a capability that is missing
entirely rather than a ranking that could be improved. The only place the
information lives is the note bodies, so the graph is derived by scanning them.

The graph is cached: rebuilding means pulling every note body, which is wasted
work on a library that has not changed between two calls in the same session.
